    <h2>Red Bean Paste Mochi</h2>

    <p>
        Mochi are small,sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko). They have a soft, chewy outer layer
        and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is
        optional but it does make the process easier.

    <p>
        Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour, or mochigome. It has a soft, chewy texture
        that is somewhat elastic. Mochi is often flavored with macha (or green tea powder), which gives it a light green hue.
