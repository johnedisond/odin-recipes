    <h2>Old School Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>
        This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese recipe. <br>
        A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and potato chip crust.
    </p>

    <p>
        This recipe makes a lot. If you aren't cooking it right away, just keep the topping separate
        until you are ready to put it in the oven.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 pounds whole-wheat macaroni</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) package shredded American cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) bag potato chips (ex. Lays), crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degress F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
            stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly;
            cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture,
            whisking continually until filly incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups of milk to the
            mixturem whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into
            the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the
            package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half
            package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated,
            remove sauce from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
        <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the
            potato chip mixture with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
